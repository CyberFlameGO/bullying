# Bullying Form
Form that enables students to anonymously report bullying and harm

My principal asked me to set up a form where students could report bullying or harm anonymously.
Took 20 mins to write, so thought I'd share with others if they found it useful.

There is a link on our portal to the form:
![form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mathsnz/bullying/master/Images/Form.jpg)

When students fill it in they get a confirmation:
![submitted](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mathsnz/bullying/master/Images/Form%202.jpg)

And an email like below is sent through to the nominated email address
![email](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mathsnz/bullying/master/Images/Email.jpg)

Requirements:
- A server running PHP
- Editing 7 lines in index.php
We have ours running on the same server as our KAMAR portal.

If you've got any questions let me know.
